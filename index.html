        <h2>Little bit about why i like video games</h2>
        <p>
         I enjoy playing video games a lot to where i don't know where i got this hobby.
         Some people think that it might be a good way to pass the time but i take it as
         a way to learn more about the system and how to improve on the newer games coming out.
        </p>

        <h3>What type of video games do i usually play</h3>

        <p>
          I play all types of video games and I'm open to playing any game. My favorite games 
          to play are usually either sports games or FPS games which is what i like to play a lot.
          Overall I love video games as a hobby and I am hoping in the future that i can create a game
          that everyone can enjoy.
